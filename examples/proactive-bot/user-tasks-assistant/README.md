# ![teams logo](./docs/images/teams-logo.png) Teams Copilot Starter

The Teams Copilot Starter project has been developed as a starter template for solutions targeting generative AI chatbots in Microsoft Teams. Unlike traditional code samples, this starter project was developed with an eye on production deployments with uncompromised engineering fundamentals. It leverages the Teams AI Library to provide natural language conversations, formulating responses as generic text or rich Adaptive Cards. The bot included in the template is engineered to be invoked through direct conversations and a search-based message extension (that can plug into Microsoft 365 Chat).

![Flow-diagram](./docs/images/flow-diagram.png)

This project is built using the TeamsFx Toolkit, which provides a simple set of functions allowing the application to be built, debugged and deployed to Azure.

## Get Started

**To get started, head over to the [Getting Started Guide](./docs/get-started.md).**

## Teams Copilot Starter Capabilities

![App](./docs/images/Teams%20Copilot%20Starter.gif)

The Teams Copilot Starter has a number of functionalities that are accessible via Teams as described below.

- Natural Language Modelling
- Prompt Engineering
- Conversation History
- Localization
- Semantic Skills
- Actions & Dynamic Prompt Functions
- Chained, Sequential and Parallel Execution of Actions
- Support for Azure Open AI, Open AI or custom AI Copilot
- External Data Sources
- Customization
- Single Sign-on with authorized access to a secured API

> **Note:** The Single Sign-on with authorized access to a secured API function is disable by default. This is because by issue on the TeamAI Library that is not yet able to fully use BlobStorage as state in combination with SSO. This is described in issue <https://github.com/microsoft/teams-ai/issues/1457>. To enable SSO see section [Enable Single Sign-on with authorized access to a secured API](#enable-single-sign-on-with-authorized-access-to-a-secured-api).

### Natural Language Modelling

The Teams Copilot Starter is built to leverage OpenAI Large Language Models so you don't have to create your own. This saves you the complexity of processing natural language, and allows your users to talk to your app with their own words.

### Prompt Engineering

With a simple text file written in human language, you can describe the functionality of your Copilot skills to cue OpenAI to focus on the right user intentions and provide relevant responses.

### Conversation History

The Teams Copilot Starter can maintain the conversation history with user. The state of your user's session is not lost, allowing conversations to flow freely and arrive quickly at right outcome.

### Localization

Because OpenAI's models are trained on the open internet, they're tuned to any language, saving you the cost of localization.

### Semantic Skills

Today's AI models can easily generate messages and images for users. While this is helpful when building a simple chat app, it is not enough to build fully automated AI agents that can automate business processes and empower users to achieve more. To do so, you would need a framework that can take the responses from these models and use them to call existing code to actually do something productive.
With Semantic Skills, we've done just that. Teams Copilot Starter allows you to easily describe your existing code to AI models so they can request that they be called. Afterwards, Teams Copilot Starter skill actions do the heavy lifting of translating the model's response into a call to your code.

To see how this works, head over to the [Skills Customization Guide](./docs/concepts/skill-customization.md).

### Actions & Dynamic Prompt Functions

Leveraging provided prompts, Teams Copilot Starter creates a predictive action plan that detects user intents and map them to relevant app actions, where you can focus your business logic. These actions are even possible to chain together to make building complex workflows easy.
Sometimes, before executing a particular action, you want to call an external function to embed the result in your prompt text. To accomplish this, we've made it possible via dynamic prompt functions by using the `{{ functionName }}` syntax. For more information on dynamic prompt functions and how they can be used within the prompt templates, see [Dynamic Prompts](./docs/concepts/dynamic-prompt.md) and for more information on Action Planner, see [Action Planner](./docs/concepts/action-planner.md) guide.

### Support for Azure Open AI, Open AI or custom AI Copilot

The Teams Copilot Starter is made to support various AI systems for moderating input and output, generating plans, and executing them. The following AI systems are currently supported are:

- Azure Open AI
- Open AI
- Custom Copilot AI

### External Data Sources

External data sources allow the injection of relevant information from external sources into prompts, such as vector databases or cognitive search. A vector data source makes it easy to add [RAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering#Retrieval-augmented_generation) to any prompt, allowing for better and more accurate replies from the bot. Teams Copilot Starter comes with two RAG options:

1. A built-in local vector database for Node.js, called Vectra. Using Vectra you can chat with either a website content (must be publicly accessible) or locally uploaded documents in either text (TXT) or PDF format. For each data source, a max number of tokens to use can be specified via `maxTokens` variable. For more information see [Vectra](./docs/concepts/vectra.md) guide.
2. Azure AI Search, that provides secure information retrieval at scale over user-owned content in traditional and generative AI search applications. For more information, see [What's Azure AI Search?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-what-is-azure-search). Across the Azure platform, Azure AI Search can integrate with other Azure services in the form of indexers that automate data ingestion/retrieval from Azure data sources, and skillsets that incorporate consumable AI from Azure AI services, such as image and natural language processing, or custom AI that you create in Azure Machine Learning or wrap inside Azure Functions. To build your own Azure AI Search Indexer, follow the steps described in this article: [Create an index in Azure AI Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-how-to-create-search-index?tabs=portal).

### Enable Single Sign-on with authorized access to a secured API

To enable Single Sign-on with authorized access to a secured API the following code need to be changed

1. In /src/index.ts, comment the lines 68-72 that defined the storage as BlobStorage. Uncomment the line 75 to define the MemoryStorage
1. In /src/bot/teamsAI.ts, in line 137 set the autoSignIn to true. This will allow Single Sign-in to start of every message.

For more information see: [Enable SSO](./docs/concepts/enable-sso.md).

## Customization

See [Skill Customization Guide](./docs/concepts/skill-customization.md) and [Action Customization Guide](./docs/concepts/action-customization.md) to explore all the ways to customize this starter project based on specific requirements such as adding new semantic skills and actions, external data sources, adaptive cards, and more.

## Run it Locally

### Prerequisites

 To run the bot in your local dev machine, you will need:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), supported versions: 16, 18. The verified Node version that this project supports is 18.19.0
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), supported version 1.22. 
- A [Microsoft 365 account for development](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/accounts) for Microsoft Teams. This account need to be enabled to manually side load Teams App into your Teams Tenant.
- Visual Studio Code.
- [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) version 5.0.0 and higher or [TeamsFx CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-cli)
- An [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/) to host the required Azure resources.
- An Azure OpenAI Service with the following model deployments (refer to the [Azure OpenAI Service documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models#standard-deployment-model-availability) for model availability by region):
  - The Azure OpenAI Service has a model deployed with deployment name `gpt-4o` and model name `gpt-4o`
  - The Azure OpenAI Service has a model deployed with deployment name `text-embedding` and model name `text-embedding-3-large`
- A storage account in your Azure Subscription

## Setting up the sample

1. Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/teams-copilot-starter.git
    ```

1. Duplicate the `.env.dev` in the `env/` folder. Rename the file to `.env.local`.

1. Fill the `OPENAI_KEY`, `OPENAI_ENDPOINT`, `OPENAI_MODEL`, `OPENAI_API_VERSION`, `OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL`, `STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME`, `STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY`, `AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT` and `AZURE_SEARCH_KEY` variables appropriately.

1. Set `TEAMSFX_ENV` to `local` and set `VECTRA_INDEX_PATH` to `../index` in the `.env.local` file.

1. Fill the `AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_SEARCH_INDEX_NAME` and `AZURE_SEARCH_SOURCE_NAME` optional variables if you choose to use Azure AI Search to index your own documents in one of the available Azure storages. Additionally, uncomment the corresponding lines that write these variable into Environment Variables in `teamsapp.<env>.yml` file.

1. Copy the `env.[env].user.template` file into `env.local.user` file for Local environment or to `env.dev.user` for the Dev environment.

1. Fill the following environment variables with the values from your Azure environment.

```yaml
# These value need to be updated before running provision.
SECRET_OPENAI_KEY=
SECRET_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY=
SECRET_STORAGE_SAS_TOKEN=
SECRET_APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATION_KEY=
SECRET_AZURE_SEARCH_KEY=
SECRET_CUSTOM_API_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

*NOTE*: If you want your prompt template to use a different model other than the default (configured in the `OPENAI_MODEL` environment variable), you can set the model inside the `completion` object that is defined in the `config.json` file in the `prompts` folder.

## Environment Variables

When you run the sample using the default TeamsFx launch configurations (i.e. 'Debug (Edge)') locally, TeamsFx will run the `teamsapp.local.yml` pipeline. This pipeline and the TeamsFx debug tasks (`.vscode/tasks.json`) will save new environment variables to the `.env.local` file for subsequent runs. At the bottom of the `teamsapp.local.yml` file, you will see the following:

```bash
# Generate runtime environment variables for bot
# Custom Settings
  - uses: file/createOrUpdateEnvironmentFile
    with:
      target: ./src/.localConfigs
      envs:
        # Required custom environment variables
        OPENAI_KEY: ${{SECRET_OPENAI_KEY}}
        OPENAI_ENDPOINT: ${{OPENAI_ENDPOINT}}
        ....
```

This action in the pipeline copies the environment variables from the `.env.local` file to the `src/.localConfigs` file. The bot will use this `.localConfigs` file for loading the environment variables when running locally. The npm script `dev:teamsfx` that is executed injects the `.localConfigs` file as environment variables before running the application.

## Testing the sample

### Teams App Test Tool

The easiest and fastest way to get up and running is with Teams App Test Tool as your local development guide.

>Note:
>Teams App Test Tool is available in the latest prerelease version of the Microsoft Teams Toolkit. Ensure that you install the [latest prerelease version](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/install-teams-toolkit#install-a-pre-release-version) of the Teams Toolkit.

Teams App Test Tool (Test Tool) makes debugging bot-based apps effortless. You can chat with your bot and see its messages and Adaptive Cards as they appear in Microsoft Teams. You don’t need a Microsoft 365 developer account, tunneling, or Teams app and bot registration to use Test Tool. For more info on what Teams App Test Tool can offer, see this [document](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/debug-your-teams-app-test-tool?tabs=vscode%2Cclijs).

To get Teams Copilot Starter debugging with Teams App Test Tool, follow these steps:

1. Clone `.env.testtool.template` file in `env` folder to `.env.testtool`, then follow the above table to fill out the blanks for the required environment variables.

2. Select `Debug in Test Tool (Preview)` from the Debug Menu, and start the debug (F5).

Optionally, in the project root folder, create `.teamsapptesttool.yml` configuration file that contains the information about the bot, tenant and the test users you want to be part of your test. Below is shown an example configuration file that you can modify per your requirements. For example, you may want to replace the `currentUser` with your real user information from the tenant where you want to test this bot.

```yml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://aka.ms/teams-app-test-tool-config/0.1.0/config.schema.json
# Visit https://aka.ms/teams-app-test-tool-config-guide for more details on this file.

# This configuration file customizes the Teams context information like chats, teams, and users.
# It contains mock data for testing Bot Framework APIs or Bot Builder SDK methods such as TeamsInfo.getTeamMembers().
# You can customize this file to change API response if your bot code uses these APIs.

```

It's vital to recognize that updating the configuration file has three major impacts:

- It influences the responses obtained from Bot Framework Connector APIs, for example, `TeamsInfo.getPagedMembers()`.
- It shapes the details in the activity payload, for example, activity.recipient.
- It impacts the user interface in Test Tool, for example, group chat names.

>Note: please consult with the Teams App Test Tool documentation about the current limitations of using this framework when testing your Teams Copilot Starter project.

#### Feature not available in Teams App Test tool

The following features are not available in the Teams App Test tool

There following prompts can be used:

- `Hi`
The App will response with a welcome message.
- `Tell me about Microsoft`
The app will give a description of Microsoft
- `Give me details about Microsoft`  
The app will give a detail financial description of Microsoft.
    >Be aware that the data shown is fake and made up by OpenAI.
- `Find founders https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft`
This will read and index the webpage and give back an adaptive card with answer
- `Summarize document` and upload a Text or PDF document.
The bot will read and index the uploaded document and give back and adaptive card with the answer.

## Deploy to Azure

## Known Issues

You may encounter the following known issues documented and assigned for the futher investigation in the repo's Issues section:

### Issue [#1](https://github.com/microsoft/teams-copilot-starter/issues/15): When using combined action with a url "give me details about Microsoft and summarize https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", the webretrieval fails.

When a prompt of a user contains multiple actions the same prompt is sent to each action. In case of Webretrieval this might lead that the AI is generation the wrong response and will use  the first part of the prompt to answer the question of the retreived website. 

This issue will be addressed in the upcoming updates and the status of this issue fix will be posted in the Issues section of the repo.
